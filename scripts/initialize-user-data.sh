#### TEST COMMIT

# This file should be sourced, not run.

# This script will do build slave setup, including creating credentials for the
# jenkins user, based on root's credentials (will copy its keys). The script is
# expected to be sourced early in the user-data phase after provisioning.

# It will also create a port forwarding rule from port 222 to localhost:22. This
# is equivalent to logging in on port 22, but the reason this is necessary is to
# stop Jenkins from logging in too early. If it tries to login too early, it
# will find the port open, but the key for the jenkins user might not be
# accepted yet, and it will give up. However, if we keep port 222 closed until
# we know it's ready, it will keep trying and eventually succeed.

# Make sure error detection and verbose output is on, if they aren't already.
